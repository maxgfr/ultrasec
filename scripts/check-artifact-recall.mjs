// Recall guard for regenerated ENGINE-OUTPUT artifacts.
//
// The problem this exists to solve, in one sentence: some committed artifacts
// are this repo's own product and must never move on an engine bump, and some
// ARE the engine's output and legitimately move on every one. Treating the
// second kind as a hard red is how an engine pin rots — ultrasec's sat seven
// releases behind because twelve goldens moved and every nightly re-pin died on
// them. Treating it as free is worse: an engine that quietly stopped finding a
// class of bugs would be committed as the new "expected" and pushed to main.
//
// So the re-pin regenerates them, and this compares the regenerated artifacts to
// the committed ones and fails only on LOSS. Enrichment — more findings, more
// fields, new files — passes. Losing something is a human decision, never an
// automatic push.
//
// What "loss" means, per file type:
//   *.json  every array in the structure, keyed by its path; a shorter array is
//           a loss. `["a","b"] -> ["a"]` fails, `-> ["a","b","c"]` passes.
//   *.snap  every object key appearing in the text; fewer occurrences of
//           `"ruleId":` means fewer findings, fewer `"related":` means a
//           cross-file link was dropped. Text, because a vitest snapshot is not
//           JSON and hand-parsing it would break on the next vitest release.
//   other   line count. Blunt on purpose: a prose report that got shorter is
//           worth a human look, and a file with no finer structure gives
//           nothing better to measure.
//
// Keys under FEWER_IS_BETTER are exempt: a shrinking `warnings` or `todo` array
// is the fix landing, not recall being lost.
//
// Usage: node scripts/check-artifact-recall.mjs [--ref HEAD] [--verbose]
// Exit 0 = nothing lost · 1 = something was lost · 2 = usage/runtime error.
