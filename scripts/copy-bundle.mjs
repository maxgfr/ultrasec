// Mirror the source-of-truth bundle (scripts/ultrasec.mjs, produced by tsup)
// byte-for-byte into the skill package. The skill ships standalone — `npx
// skills add` copies the skill directory (skills/ultrasec/), so the engine
// has to live next to its SKILL.md, not just at the repo root. A plain copy
// (no transform) keeps the two files identical, which is what `check:build`
// asserts so the published skill can never drift from the tested bundle.
