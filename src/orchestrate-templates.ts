You are auditing ONE batch of candidates of an ultrasec security review — the OPEN candidates the deterministic engine enumerated. They are recall-oriented: many are false positives by design; you decide, from the real code.

Worklist: \`${join(runAbs, "findings.json")}\` (the audit dossier's candidate list; repo root: \`${repoAbs}\`). Handle ONLY the findings whose \`id\` is named in your prompt (\`ITEMS=<id,…>\`).

For EACH of your candidate ids:

1. Run \`node ${engineAbs} dossier <id> --run ${runAbs}\` (read-only) — the grounding packet: the real code along the cross-file path, graph neighbours, and how to verify.
2. Read the code along EVERY hop of the printed path (open the cited files when the excerpts alone cannot decide). Decide: is the SOURCE attacker-controlled? does the value reach the SINK through every hop unchanged? is there a sanitizer/validator/authz guard on the path? is the SINK exploitable with the value that arrives (write the PoC)?
3. Rule it:
   - \`supported\` — the flow is real and exploitable. REQUIRES \`exploitPath\` (who · what they send · what they get).
   - \`partial\` — a real issue, but weaker or narrower than claimed.
   - \`unsupported\` — the evidence does not establish the claim.
   - \`refuted\` — the source positively contradicts the claim (name the guard/sanitizer \`[file:line]\`).
   Default to the harsher verdict ONLY when you can disprove it; otherwise mark \`partial\`/leave it for a human.
4. Be conservative. The fold never auto-dismisses a high/critical finding on anything short of an explicit \`refuted\` — an uncertain high-severity finding stays **needs-human**, never dropped. Every claim in your \`note\` must cite resolvable \`[file:line]\` hops you actually read.

Return (structured output): \`{ "verdicts": [{ "id", "verdict", "note", "exploitPath" }] }\` — your ITEMS only.
${footer}`,
    skeptic: `# Contract: skeptic

You are an adversarial skeptic verifying the pending findings of an ultrasec audit. Assume each claim is wrong until the source proves it — try to REFUTE it.

Worklist: \`${join(runAbs, "VERIFY.todo.json")}\` (a JSON array; each entry has \`id\`, \`severity\`, \`cwe\`, \`title\`, \`category\`, \`claim\`, \`files[]\`; repo root: \`${repoAbs}\`). Handle ONLY the entries whose \`id\` is named in your prompt (\`ITEMS=<id,…>\`).

For EACH of your entries:

1. Open every cited \`file:line\` in \`files[]\` and read it in context; run \`node ${engineAbs} dossier <id> --run ${runAbs}\` (read-only) for the full cross-file packet.
2. Judge the claim against the source — is the flow **real and exploitable**?
   - \`supported\` — real and exploitable exactly as claimed (include \`exploitPath\`).
   - \`partial\` — a real issue, but the claim overstates it (wrong hop, narrower reach, weaker impact).
   - \`unsupported\` — the source does not establish the claim.
   - \`refuted\` — the source contradicts the claim (name the guard/sanitizer \`[file:line]\`).
3. Be skeptical, but do NOT dismiss a high/critical finding unless you can positively **refute** it — the fold sends an \`unsupported\`/\`partial\` high-severity finding to **needs-human**, never auto-dropped. Uncertain ⇒ leave it for a human.
4. \`note\` is REQUIRED — one line grounded in what you read, citing resolvable \`[file:line]\`. If the entry carries a \`priorSignal\`, it is a HINT, never a verdict — adjudicate yourself.

Return (structured output): \`{ "verdicts": [{ "id", "verdict", "note", "exploitPath" }] }\` — your ITEMS only.

    revalidator: `# Contract: revalidator

You revalidate findings already ranked real (confirmed / needs-human) against git history — the false-positive cut.

Worklist: \`${join(runAbs, "REVALIDATE.todo.json")}\` (a JSON array; each entry has \`id\`, \`severity\`, \`title\`, \`at\`, plus compact git facts: \`fileExists\`, \`currentLine\`, \`commitsSinceFinding\`, \`lineLastChanged\`, \`renamedTo\`; repo root: \`${repoAbs}\`). Handle ONLY the entries whose \`id\` is named in your prompt (\`ITEMS=<id,…>\`).

For EACH of your entries:

1. Read the git facts, then open the cited file at HEAD (\`at\`, or \`renamedTo\` when the file moved) and check whether the vulnerable code is still there.
2. Decide whether the issue is still live:
   - \`still-valid\` — the cited code is still vulnerable at HEAD.
   - \`fixed\` — the code was corrected; include \`fixedIn\` (the fixing commit sha — else the fold infers it from \`lineLastChanged\`).
   - \`false-positive\` — the finding was never a real issue (say why, grounded).
   - \`uncertain\` — the facts cannot settle it. A valid, honest verdict.
3. The fold is conservative: \`fixed\` → dismissed recording the fixing commit; a high/critical \`false-positive\` → **needs-human** (never auto-dismissed); \`uncertain\`/unknown → needs-human; \`still-valid\` keeps the finding (flagged if the cited location drifted at HEAD).
4. \`note\` is REQUIRED — one line grounded in the git facts / code you read, citing resolvable \`[file:line]\`.

    hunter: `# Contract: hunter

You hunt the bugs the deterministic engine can't enumerate — missing/incorrect **authz** & **IDOR**, **business-logic** flaws, and multi-hop taint — one attack-surface region at a time.

Worklist: \`${join(runAbs, "INVESTIGATE.todo.json")}\` (a JSON array; each entry has \`region\`, \`files[]\`, \`neighbors[]\`, \`prompt\`; paths are relative to the repo root \`${repoAbs}\`). Handle ONLY the regions named in your prompt (\`ITEMS=<region,…>\`).

For EACH of your regions:

1. Read the region's \`files[]\` and \`neighbors[]\` (read-only; \`node ${engineAbs} graph <file> --repo ${repoAbs}\` shows the cross-file links). Follow the region's \`prompt\`.
2. Hunt what the deterministic pass can't see: missing/incorrect authorization & IDOR, business-logic flaws, feature abuse, and multi-hop taint that crosses these files.
3. Only report what you can exploit — a concrete attacker scenario (who · what they send · what they get), not "potentially". A defense-in-depth gap another layer already prevents is a hardening note, not a Discovery.
4. Every citation must resolve: the ingest REJECTS a Discovery whose \`[file:line]\` doesn't exist, and a Discovery at an existing finding's location folds into its \`sources\` (no duplicate). Discoveries land as \`ultrasec-ai\` **open** candidates and are adjudicated like any other — an uncertain high-severity one stays needs-human downstream, never dropped — so ground every claim, then don't fear reporting it.

7. **Render**: \`${engine} render --run ${runAbs}\` (optionally author the narrative first: \`${engine} narrative --run ${runAbs}\`). Loop from step 2 on a new sub-question until a round surfaces nothing new.

With subagents available, prefer the emitted workflows instead: \`orchestrate --run ${runAbs} --phase <p>\` then \`Workflow({ scriptPath: "${join(runAbs, "orchestration", "<p>.workflow.mjs")}" })\` — you stay the sole writer either way.
